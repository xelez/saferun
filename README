Saferun is a library for safely exection of programs with limiting of execution time and memory usage.

SRun is a sample app that uses this library.

Dependences:
 * cmake >= 2.6 - for building
 * recent kernel with cgroup cpuacct, devices and memory subsystems support
 * mounted cgroup filesystem
 * libcap-dev

More about kernel:
 * It must be compiled with:
    CONFIG_CGROUPS=y
    CONFIG_CGROUP_DEVICE=y
    CONFIG_CGROUP_CPUACCT=y
    CONFIG_CGROUP_MEM_RES_CTLR=y
    CONFIG_CGROUP_MEM_RES_CTLR_SWAP=y
    CONFIG_CGROUP_MEM_RES_CTLR_SWAP_ENABLED=y
    CONFIG_RESOURCE_COUNTERS=y
    CONFIG_UTS_NS=y
    CONFIG_IPC_NS=y
    CONFIG_PID_NS=y
    CONFIG_NET_NS=y
 * You can see if kernel compiled with these flags
   $ cat /boot/config-`uname -r` | grep _NS
   $ cat /boot/config-`uname -r` | grep CGROUP
   $ cat /boot/config-`uname -r` | grep RESOURCE_COUNTERS
 * Recent Ubuntu and Debian Testing works
 * Debian 6.0 Squeeze compiled without cgroup memory subsystem, but you can use backported kernel
   from http://backports-master.debian.org/

More about cgroup:
 * On Ubuntu you can just install cgroup-lite and it would mount it automatically on boot
 * Or you can add do the following as root:
   # mkdir /cgroup
   # echo >> /etc/fstab
   # echo 'cgroup /cgroup cgroup defaults 0 0' >> /etc/fstab
   # mount /cgroup
   This will automatically mount cgroup on boot.
   

How to build:
$ mkdir -p build/release
$ cd build/release
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../../
$ make

How to build .deb:
$ cd build/release
$ cpack -G deb

Saferun is based on Linux Containers and Namespaces, see documentation:
